                <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Pedro Guitian. I am a sophomore at Marist College
                        pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, with a concentration
                        in Software Development and a minor in Cybersecurity. I am set to graduate
                        in May 2027</p>

                    <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in programming languages
                    such as Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have cultivated
                    expertise in database design and implementation</p>

                    <p>In Fall 2024, I collaborated with a team to develop Filtr, an MVP of a dating app
                        designed to connect young individuals. My contributions included designing
                        the database structure, implementing complex queries, and developing the 
                        matching algorithm that forms the core of the user experience. These efforts 
                        significantly enhanced the app’s functionality and user engagement.</p>
